# Marketing-Department-Project
Marketing is a crucial part of any business. Markerters need to know their customers and identify their needs. In this project, we analyse data provided by a bank in New York. The marketing department wants to launch a targeted ad campaign by segmenting their customers into groups. I apply data science to apply market segmentation. This project includes exploratory data analysis, K-means clustering and Principal Component Analysis.
